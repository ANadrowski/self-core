Self's Core. This repo contains the main Java SE Implementation, clean of any framework.

The platform's domain model is implemented as a set of public Java Interfaces which, besides being the skeleton of the core implementation, can also be used to implement Selenium tests or implement a Java client for the RESTful API.

Once ready, this core will easily be pluggable into any framework or platform (Spring, Jakarta EE etc).
