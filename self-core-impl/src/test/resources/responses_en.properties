hello.comment=Hi @%s! I'm the Project Manager of this project. I take care of Issues' assignments, payments and more.\
              Want me to work for your project too? Go [here](https://self-xdsd.com). \n\n\
              I work primarily at Github, but I'll also start working at GitLab and BitBucket soon.
